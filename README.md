This document outlines a hypothetical data management plan (DMP) for the research project Criminality on Campus: Enhancing University Safety Through Understanding Criminality, funded by the ESRC and led by Loughborough University in collaboration with Cardiff University, the University of Edinburgh, and their respective student unions.

The aim of the project is to examine the nature, prevalence, and impact of criminal behaviour on UK university campuses, using a mixed-methods approach that includes administrative data, student surveys, interviews, and focus groups. The research will also explore the differential impacts of campus criminality across diverse student demographics.

This data management plan addresses key considerations such as data collection, storage, sharing, ethical compliance, anonymisation, and long-term preservation. It ensures that data handling practices support the projectâ€™s goals while maintaining participant confidentiality and aligning with institutional, legal, and funder requirements.
